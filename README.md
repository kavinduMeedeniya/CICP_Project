 Car Insurance Claim Prediction

Overview  
This project focuses on predicting whether a car insurance policyholder will make a claim using data mining and machine learning techniques.  
It aims to help insurance companies assess risk, reduce fraudulent claims, and make data-driven decisions to improve financial management and customer fairness.



Objective  
The main goal of the project is to develop a predictive model that analyzes customer and vehicle information to determine the likelihood of an insurance claim.  
By identifying potential claim patterns, the system can support insurance providers in managing risks and designing fair premium strategies.



Process  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared data for analysis by handling inconsistencies and transforming variables.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified trends and key factors influencing claim likelihood through visual and statistical insights.  
3. **Model Development:** Trained multiple machine learning models to predict claim outcomes.  
4. **Model Evaluation:** Compared models to ensure accuracy and reliability in prediction.  
5. **Implementation:** Built a lightweight prototype application that provides claim predictions based on user input.


Tools & Technologies  
- **Programming Language:** Python for backend / React for frontend 
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code
